**Project Overview**: Design FSMs using Verilog or VHDL in the VLSI Software Environment
This project involves designing Finite State Machines (FSMs) using Verilog or VHDL, two of the most widely used hardware description languages in the VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) industry. The objective is to model a system with distinct states, transitions between states, and the associated outputs based on the current state and inputs.

Project Goals
Design FSMs:

Define the states and transitions of the system based on the requirements.
Implement the FSM logic using Verilog or VHDL.
Test Bench Development:

Create test benches to test the functionality of the FSM.
Apply various input sequences to ensure that the FSM transitions between states correctly.
Simulation:

Simulate the FSM to verify its behavior.
Use a waveform viewer to analyze state transitions and verify the correctness of outputs for different inputs.
Project Breakdown
1. Finite State Machine (FSM) Design
Types of FSMs:

Moore Machine: Output is determined by the current state only.
Mealy Machine: Output depends on the current state and inputs.
Key Elements:

States: Define the various stages of the system.
Inputs: Signals that determine state transitions.
Outputs: Signals that are triggered based on the state.
State Transitions: Define the rules for transitioning from one state to another.
Steps:

Define the state diagram.
Convert the state diagram into Verilog or VHDL code.
Use always blocks (Verilog) or process statements (VHDL) for describing sequential logic.
Example FSM Application:

A traffic light controller with three states: Green, Yellow, and Red.
Transition between states based on a clock or input signals.
2. Writing Test Benches
Test Bench Purpose: A test bench provides input stimuli to the FSM to verify correct functionality.

Key Elements:

Initial Conditions: Initialize signals.
Clock Generation: A clock signal to synchronize state transitions.
Input Stimuli: Apply different combinations of inputs to test state transitions.
Assertions/Monitors: Check if the FSM transitions and outputs match the expected behavior.
Example:

If designing a traffic light controller, a test bench could simulate the system with clock inputs to verify the correct sequence of state transitions from Green to Yellow to Red.
3. Simulation and Verification
VLSI Software Tools: Use tools like ModelSim, Vivado, or Cadence Xcelium for simulation.
Simulation Process:
Compile the FSM design and the test bench.
Run the simulation with varying inputs to verify the FSM behavior.
Capture waveforms to visualize state transitions and confirm correctness.
Expected Outputs:
A correctly designed FSM will exhibit the desired state transitions and output behavior based on the input stimuli.
Waveform Analysis: Use a waveform viewer to check if the FSM changes states at the correct clock cycles and outputs the right signals.
